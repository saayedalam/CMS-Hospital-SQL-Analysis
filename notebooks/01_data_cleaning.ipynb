    "# 🧼 Data Cleaning: CMS Hospital General Information\n",

    "In this notebook, we clean and prepare the **CMS Hospital General Information dataset** — a publicly available dataset from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS): 🔗 [CMS Hospital Dataset](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/xubh-q36u)\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains detailed information about U.S. hospitals, including names, locations, types, ownership structures, emergency services, and various performance metrics (e.g. mortality, safety, readmission, patient experience, and timely care).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧭 Cleaning Objectives\n",
    "Our goal is to prepare a clean, analysis-ready version of this dataset for PostgreSQL import and SQL-based analysis. This includes:\n",
    "- Loading the raw CMS CSV into a pandas DataFrame\n",
    "- Previewing column names, structure, and sample data\n",
    "- Dropping footnote and metadata columns with high missingness\n",
    "- Inspecting and converting numeric-like string columns\n",
    "- Verifying uniqueness of the primary key (`Facility ID`)\n",
    "- Saving the final cleaned dataset to disk"
