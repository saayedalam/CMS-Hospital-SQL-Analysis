    "# 🧮 SQL-Driven Exploration: CMS Hospital Dataset\n",

    "This notebook showcases my SQL expertise through a structured, self-directed analysis of the **CMS Hospital General Information** dataset — a public dataset from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS):  \n",
    "🔗 [CMS Hospital General Information Dataset](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/xubh-q36u)\n",

    "### 🎯 Project Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this notebook is to demonstrate practical SQL proficiency by performing meaningful, interview-relevant analysis **entirely through SQL**. All queries were written from scratch, based on questions I designed myself to explore patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 What This Notebook Shows\n",
    "\n",
    "- My ability to **write clean, modular, and well-commented SQL code**\n",
    "- Critical thinking through **self-directed question framing**\n",
    "- Comfort with a range of SQL operations:  \n",
    "  ✅ Filtering and aggregation  \n",
    "  ✅ Window functions and ranking  \n",
    "  ✅ Set operations (e.g., `UNION`, `EXCEPT`)  \n",
    "  ✅ CASE logic and derived metrics  \n",
    "  ✅ String and date functions  \n",
    "  ✅ Joins and subqueries  \n",
    "  ✅ Pivot-style queries with conditional aggregation  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each section includes:\n",
    "- A clear question framed in business or stakeholder language  \n",
    "- A SQL query executed directly on a PostgreSQL database  \n",
    "- A short summary interpreting the output in plain language  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> This notebook represents a real-world analyst workflow — not just SQL syntax practice — and is intended to show hiring managers both **technical depth** and **analytical thought process**."

    "This query pivots hospital overall ratings into columns by ownership type, showing the count of hospitals for each star rating (1 to 5 stars). For example, **Voluntary non-profit - Private** owns the largest number of hospitals (**2280**), with a broad distribution of ratings across the scale. Other ownership types such as **Proprietary** and **Government - Hospital District or Authority** also show distinct rating distributions, highlighting differences in hospital quality by ownership."

    "## 🎯 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a comprehensive and practical application of SQL skills on a real-world hospital dataset. Through 28 thoughtfully designed queries, I have explored a variety of important aspects such as hospital distribution, rating patterns, ownership impact, and performance tiers across states and cities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways include:\n",
    "- Geographic and ownership-based variation in hospital counts and quality ratings.\n",
    "- Identification of data gaps like missing ratings by state.\n",
    "- Advanced SQL techniques such as window functions (`RANK()`, `LAG()`, `NTILE()`), Common Table Expressions (CTEs), set operations (`UNION`, `EXCEPT`), and pivot-style aggregations.\n",
    "- Realistic business questions answered through SQL, showcasing my ability to extract actionable insights for stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "This end-to-end exploration highlights my proficiency with SQL fundamentals, advanced querying, and data storytelling—key skills for any data analyst or data scientist role. The structured approach also prepares me to build dashboards and reports that communicate findings effectively to business stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "I look forward to applying these skills in real-world projects and continuing to deepen my expertise with more complex datasets and use cases."
